Description: Uniform manifold approximation and projection is a technique for dimension reduction. The algorithm was described by McInnes and Healy (2018) in <arXiv:1802.03426>. This package provides an interface for two implementations. One is written from scratch, including components for nearest-neighbor search and for embedding. The second implementation is a wrapper for 'python' package 'umap-learn' (requires separate installation, see vignette for more details).
